# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1st July, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned HTML by Building CatPhotoApp.

**Thoughts:** Learning Syntax and nesting was a challenge but, with few re-dos it was okay to complete. Learned a lot about different objects and sections on a webpage

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
